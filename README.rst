About linear-QSSA branch
*******
This branch features a modification of Cantera Version 2.3.0 (stable) to include the capability of linear quasi-steady-state approximation for gas-phase kinetics. One sample for the usage of linear-QSSA model is included in **samples/cxx/qss_ignition/**. The corresponding mechanism files are in **data/inputs/**. 

This version is made for people who wish to use the linear-QSSA feature as is, before I have time to make proper modifications to close the `pull request #437 <https://github.com/Cantera/cantera/pull/437>`_.
